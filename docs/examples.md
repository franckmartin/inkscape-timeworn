## Tips for Custom Effects

!!! tip "Layering"
    Apply the extension multiple times with different parameters for complex, multi-layered weathering.

!!! tip "Color Variations"
    After generating spots, use Inkscape's color tools to create rust, patina, or other colored weathering effects.

!!! tip "Masking"
    Use different boundary shapes to create selective weathering in specific areas.

!!! tip "Blur & Opacity"
    Combine with Inkscape's blur filter and opacity settings for softer, more subtle effects.
